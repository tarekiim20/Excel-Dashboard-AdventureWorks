# Excel Dashboard for AdventureWorks Sales Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to the **Excel Dashboard for AdventureWorks Sales Analysis** project! This project showcases the power of Excel as both a reporting and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool. By leveraging **Power Query**, **Power Pivot**, and **Pivot Tables**, I created a comprehensive one-page dashboard to analyze sales data from the AdventureWorks2012 database.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Source**: Based on the AdventureWorks2012 database. The backup file (`.bak`) is available in the repository.
- **ETL Process**: Established a connection from Excel to SQL Server and utilized Power Query for data transformation.
- **Data Modeling**: Created a snowflake schema using Power Pivot to organize and relate the data effectively.
- **Insights Generation**: Extracted valuable insights using Pivot Tables and visualized them in a user-friendly format.
- **Dashboard Design**: Developed a functional and visually appealing one-page dashboard to present the insights.

## Key Features
- **Data Integration**: Seamlessly connected Excel to SQL Server for real-time data access.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Utilized Power Pivot for complex data modeling and analysis.
- **Interactive Reporting**: Designed an interactive dashboard for dynamic data exploration.
- **Visual Appeal**: Focused on clean and intuitive design to enhance user experience.

## Conclusion
This project was an exciting journey to explore the capabilities of Excel beyond its traditional uses. While the primary goal was not to derive groundbreaking insights, it successfully demonstrated how Excel can be a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization. I applied fundamental techniques to create a valuable dashboard and am open to contributions to expand this into a multi-page dashboard with even more insights.
