# Excel-Dashboard-AdventureWorks
A full one-page Excel dashboard for analysis of sales of Adventure Works

## Summary
In this project, I tried to create a functional and insightful report using Excel. The journey was surprising to me that Excel can be used not only as a reporting tool
but also as an ETL using the powers of Power Query. I will write here a quick summary of what does this project contain.
1- It is based on AdventureWorks2012 and the backup file(.bak) can be found in the reop.
2- I created a connection from Excel to SQL Server
3- Utilized Power pivot to create a small snowflake Scheme
4- Figured out some insights from the data using pivot tables.
5- Lastly I created out a functional and well-designed dashboard to show the insights.

## Conculsion
This project is not intended to get valuable insights from the data. Instead, I tried to know how much I could do with Excel. I applied the basic tools you need to create a valuable dashboard for insights.
And I am very well open for contributions to make this more than one-page dashboard
